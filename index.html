<p>Context:
The increasing popularity of fitness and activity tracking devices and the growing “quantified self” movement means that a wealth of data is available for the assessment, change and improvement of an individuals health, fitness and wellbeing. The combination of this, the increasing availability of open data and the practice of crowdsourcing data can allow almost endless opportunities. One such idea is the creation of an application that takes health information from a user such as illnesses/conditions as well as general information including height, weight, age, ethnicity, location etc. It then records daily fitness activities, food intake and readings from an activity tracking device such as the Jawbone Up24 along with other less regular readings. The combined data can be used to develop a data visualisation and analysis platform for the user to assess their progress, see how people in similar circumstances rate and what helped them improve or reach their goals. A modified version of this platform can be provided to healthcare professionals and health/medical institutes to allow them to produce live health profiles based on various criteria similar to those available at Public Health England (<a href="http://www.apho.org.uk">http://www.apho.org.uk</a>).</p>
